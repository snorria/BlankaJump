A game I made in HTML 5 app class, It uses css3, html 5 and javascript. Built with Yeoman. It uses Howler.js for sound.
I made a really simple nodejs server for the highscore, I was rushing it and the url's are hardcoded to my home server.


I didn't go by any code standards and the final code was really bad. 
This was mostly due to time constraints...and due to javascript. 
I don't want to change it now since this is the final product I delivered.


Retrospectives:
Use coffeescript next time, since you can make classes and the code would look so much cleaner.
Make an extendable platform class for all the platforms.
Define a structure before hand, my css was horrible at the end since I didn't plan any of the features I added.
